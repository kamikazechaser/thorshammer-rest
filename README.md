# API Reference

This REST API is useful to bot developers who want to resolve a username to get the userid of a Telegram user.

_This API depends on a bot ([ThorsHammer](https://telegram.me/ThorsHammerBot)) to collect this data. As at the time of writting this the bot had 55k+ cached users. To improve this service I recommend all users to add the bot to groups as it serves 2 advantages:_
- _Protects the group from Globally Banned Users by sending a message when a banned user joins the group_
- _Allows the database to grow making this API much better_

 The data sent from this API, back and forth is formatted in JSON and the API itself is unauthenticated.
